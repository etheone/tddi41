2-1: The stratum concept is a static measure of synchronization distance as opposed to jitter or delay. From the perspective of a client, the distance is the number of servers TO a reference clock. A reference clock appears at stratum 0, while the closest servers are at stratum 1.

A hierarchy is necessary to maintain synchonization without overloading the top level servers (ie stratum 1 servers) with requests for time. A hierarchy makes load balancing possible:
           0	
     /     |      \
    1      1       1
  / | \  / | \   /  |  \
2   2  2 2 2  2  2  2   2

Plenty of servers to get time from!


2-2: 

TOY time: 1000s (startup time check)

up to 128ms adjust diff (if more than 128ms difference longer than stepout threshold (default 900s) system is stepped to correct value.


2-3: To prevent chunks of time that does not exist, (time-jumps is not desireable).
